# Material Request Form
This program obtains user input to fill out a Material request form.<br/><br/>

The program prompts the user for a vendor name, an gage ID# and a few other details.  
The gage ID is used in a simple SQL query to return a list of the item's associated attributes.  
This information, in combination with a few more user input details, is processed and written to a Microsoft Excel program.
